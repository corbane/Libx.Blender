- this project displays the contents of ".blend" files.
  This is provided only to understand and "see" the internal structure of a blend file.
- This is a draft, I will not continue to develop it.
  It is better to use Blender in the background or to compile it as a module to read and manipulate Blend files.
- This is a snippet from my library and there is probably some unnecessary code.
  Besides the user interface, the [IO/File.cs](./Libx.Blender/Source/IO/File.cs) file is probably what might interest you.
