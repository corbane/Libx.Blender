## Warning

This is a experimental project.
Provided only to understand and "see" the internal structure of a blend file.

if you want to extract or manipulate  data from a Blend file, it is better to use Blender in the background or compile it as a module ([See why not use a blend file directly](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/blender-file-format-import-library/17730)).

Originally written for batch processing and obtain basic information and statistics on several files.
